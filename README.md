# COLLAB.CEB

## Introduction/Rationale
In Cebu City, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) play a significant role in addressing various social, environmental, and humanitarian issues. However, there is a lack of a centralized platform that facilitates collaboration and communication between these organizations and their volunteers. Many NGOs struggle with finding volunteers, organizing events, and sharing important updates with the community. Additionally, there is no single space for these organizations to connect and collaborate on projects, share resources, or discuss common goals.
collab.ceb aims to bridge this gap by providing a simplified social media platform tailored specifically for NGOs in Cebu City. The platform will allow NGOs to create profiles, post updates, share events, and recruit volunteers, all while fostering collaboration between organizations. Volunteers can easily browse through available opportunities and sign up to contribute to causes they care about.
This platform will enhance the visibility and impact of local NGOs by streamlining communication and empowering both NGOs and volunteers to work more efficiently toward positive change in Cebu City.

## Detailed Description
collab.ceb will be a user-friendly social media platform designed to meet the specific needs of NGOs and volunteers in Cebu City. The key features of the platform will include
1. **NGO Profiles:** NGOs will be able to create a detailed profile showcasing their mission, goals, and upcoming events. They will also be able to post updates, share news, and engage with their community.
2. **User Profiles:** Users can register as either volunteers or NGO representatives. They will have a personal profile where they can update their information, track volunteer work, and interact with posts and events.

4. **Event Management:** NGOs will be able to create, manage, and promote events that require volunteer assistance. Volunteers can RSVP to events and track upcoming opportunities to participate.
5. **Volunteer Application System:** Volunteers can apply to events and roles within NGOs, and NGOs can approve or reject applications based on their needs.
6. **Interaction and Engagement:** The platform will allow users to like, comment, and share posts, fostering community interaction and engagement. This will encourage NGOs to actively communicate with their followers and keep them informed.
7. **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific NGOs, events, or volunteer opportunities based on categories like cause, location, or keyword.
